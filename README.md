# -Life-Expectency-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression-XGBoost-Regressor
This project employs advanced regression techniques to forecast life expectancy based on diverse socio-economic and health-related factors. By leveraging both linear regression and XGBoost regressor algorithms, we aim to accurately predict life expectancy trends and uncover significant predictors influencing lifespan.
